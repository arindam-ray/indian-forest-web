    <p align="justify"><font face ="Verdana" size=4 color="#114203">India is one of the First countries in the world to have stated scientific management of its
        forests. During the year 1864 the then British India Government started the Imperial Forest Department and
        appointed Dr. Dietrich Brandis, a German Forest officer Inspector General of Forests in 1866. Having recognized
        the need to have a premier forest service to mange the varied natural resources of the vast country and to
        organize the affairs of the Imperial Forest Department, Imperial Forest Service was constituted in 1867. Having
        realized the importance of a multi-tier forest Administration in the federal and provincial Governments for
        effective management of forest resources the British India Government also constituted Provincial Forest Service
        and Executive & Subordinate Services, which were quite similar to the present day forest administrative
        hierarchy.</font>

        Pradesh, the heart of India that forms the central Indian highlands.The national park is being popularized as
        the Tiger reserve and interestingly is being declared as one of the finest wildlife areas in the world.
        Spreading across two revenue districts the Mandala and the Kalaghat, Kanha National Park was declared a reserve
        forest in 1879 and revalued as a wildlife sanctuary in 1933. Its position was further upgraded to a national
        park in 1955. The Kanha National Park is spread across the area of 940 sq km in the Maikal chain of hills. By
        bringing up the buffer and core zone all together, the Kanha Tiger Reserve has the total area of 1945 sq km. The
        landscapes and the surrounding luxurious meadows along with the wooded strands and the dense maroons of forests

        the crystal clear streams amidst the dense jungle cleanses the surroundings and makes the wildlife unrivalled.
        This vivacious land has been the source of inspiration for Rudyard Kipling, a famous writer for his outstanding
        creation- “The Jungle Book”. The Kanha National Park is the ideal home for wide ranges of wild creatures; right
        from the mighty tigers to the most populated Barasingha and the countless species of plants, birds, reptiles and
